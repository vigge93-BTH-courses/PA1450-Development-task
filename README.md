# Development guidelines
## Pair programming
All features should be programmed in pairs, the pairs are decided on when tasks are handed out, and it is up to the pair to decide the best strategy for collaboration.

## Git guidelines
### Branches
Each feature is developed on a separate branch based on the master branch.
### Pull requests and code review
When a feature is completed a pull request is opened. Before merging, the new code should be approved by someone outside the pair.
### Merging
When a pull request is approved, the branched is merged into the master branch. Any conflicts that arise is the responsibility of the pair mergin into master.
